# Useless-ATM-re-write
I remember copying an ATM for C# tutorial a while back, and I decided to re-write it without using too many references (I still looked at some anyways lmao)
the original tutorial (that should be taking all of the credit) is https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/blogs/atm-transactions-in-c-sharp
I left a bunch of comments for you guys
